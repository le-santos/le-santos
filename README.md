### About me

I'm a web developer with professional experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React, HTML, CSS.

- ðŸ’» I'm currently working for a software consultant company called [Rebase](https://www.rebase.com.br/) and have experience in software development in different  business contexts and codebases with different Ruby on Rails applications setups (monolithic, microservices, API only, etc).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying some computer science and programming languages code concepts, following some references such as [this amazing ossu repo](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-cs).
- :musical_note: Fun fact: I have a masters degree in Music (classical guitar) and have been working as a musician/teacher for many years. I believe that practicing, analyzing, and playing complex music pieces has helped me when dealing with complex codebases and their interactions.
- ðŸ’™ Love remote jobs!


:hammer_and_wrench: Some technologies/tools I am confortable working with:
